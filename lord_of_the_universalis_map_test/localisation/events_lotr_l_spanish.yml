During their travels they will be challenged which may end their journey fast. If they don't reach the mountain and defeat Smaug then the One Ring wont be found and the Fellowship wont be formed. If they reach the mountain and survive the nation of Erebor will be formed and might be challenged by its neighbors."

 help_events.4.d: "The Fellowship Of The Ring is a Fellowship formed in the Shire and their destination is the Mount Doom in Mordor. During their travels they will be challenged which may end their journey fast. If the fellowship fails the ring will be either taken or dropped in the province they reached. Evil factions can search for the fellowship using the 'Hinder Fellowship' trade policy and also slow them down. If the ring is dropped, the nation owning the province has a chance to find the ring. Which will equip it to the ruler. If the ruler then reaches Mount Doom and controls the province the ring will be destroyed. If the ring is destroyed Mordor will be destroyed and split into smaller nations of remnant orc tribes. If Sauron gains the ring, Mordor will be incredible powerful."
